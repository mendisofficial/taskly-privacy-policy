    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        This privacy policy applies to the Taskly app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was
        created by

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        The Application <strong>does not collect, store, or share any personal information or data</strong> from its
        users.
        All tasks and related data you create within the Application are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>
        only.
        The Application does not connect to the internet, does not use analytics, and does not transmit any information
        to the Service Provider or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p>The Application does <strong>not collect or use your deviceâ€™s location data</strong>.</p>

        Since the Application does not collect any user data, no information is stored or retained by the Service
        Provider.

    <p>
        The Application does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the
